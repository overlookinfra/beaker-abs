(QENG-4472) Relax version constraints

Previously, we were pessimistically pinned to beaker 2.x, which meant
projects could not use both beaker 3 and beaker-abs simultaneously.

Beaker-abs only requires a version of beaker supporting the custom
hypervisor API. Due to a beaker bug, custom hypervisors did not work
until beaker 2.9.0 in commit d45e723cd. We also require less than beaker
4 to prevent future incompatibilities.

We want this gem to be public, and this restriction is actually getting
in the way on some of our jenkins instances, and not providing any value.
